In order to create an EBS based instance with the ephemeral device allocated, the following steps should be performed:
Use the snapshot id of the "sda1" device and the kernel id of the desired Amazon Linux AMI, e.g. "snap-74eae31a" and "aki-83396bc6"
Register the new AMI using the following command (please notice the REGION, the "--kernel aki-83396bc6" and the "-b /dev/sda1=snap-74eae31a:8:true" parameters:

ec2-register --region REGION --kernel aki-83396bc6 -n "Name" -d "Description" --root-device-name /dev/sda1 -b "/dev/sda1=snap-74eae31a:8:true" -b "/dev/sdb1=ephemeral0"

Please use resulted AMI id in the create.sh script accordingly

Expect bugs!!!
